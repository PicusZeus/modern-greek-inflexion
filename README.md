## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## To Do
The only way to say if some adjectives on -os have a common masc-fem form on -os is to have at least partial least of such adjectives. Maybe it would be possible to get it from somewhere.
