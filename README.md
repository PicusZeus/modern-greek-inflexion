# Modern-greek-inflexion

Python 3 library for creating inflected forms for Modern Greek words (verbs, adjectives, nouns etc.).
The application is implemented in a web app you can find [here](https://ellinika.com.pl).
The application requires from a user to be fed with a basic, existing Greek Lemma to work. 
Internally it works thanks to a big corpus on which it tests forms it tries to create. Thanks to it the program gives mostly good results, especially in comparison 
to all the other "conjugation" engines.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install modern-greek-inflexion.

```bash
pip install modern-greek-inflexion
```

## Change Log
 * 2.0.5 Improvements in handling of archaic attic declension on -ως
 * 2.0.4 Fixed bug that caused incorrect creation of gen pl for some indeclinable nouns.
 * 2.0.3 Fixed issue with augmentation of dimotic verbs prefixed with 'para'. Also forcibly removed katharevousan types from such verbs. Fixed issue with indeclinable nouns ending on 'a', for which previously erroneously gen pl with ων ending was being created.
 * 2.0.2 Fixed issue, when sigmatic aorist stem is created when it exists only for passive imperative (ζέστανα but ζεστάσου).
 * 2.0.1 Fixed inconsistencies in the format of the output (in pronouns, where in some cases forms were given as string and not as set of strings)
 * 2.0.0 Major code refactoring with changes that break previous API. Code is quicker by about 25%, better readability, new docs, before migrating, read usage docs.
 * 1.0.6 Minor fixes and dependency update
 * 1.0.5 A bug, that caused problems in aorist formation for compound verbs from βαίνω fixed.
 * 1.0.4 Added logic for multiple root formation in verbs on -άρω (σοκάρω, σοκαρίζω, σοκαρίσω), now the app will try to create also imperfect forms with a root on 'ιζ'. The Experiment with extending the core language check corpus failed miserably, as all the corpora I tried (even these from the EU) are unfortunately full of typos and orthographic errors, which, when used, introduced into the app huge problems. Next time I will try to use some NLTK magic and frequency lists to try them again.
 * 1.0.3 The problem with verbs with prefix para fixed by adding a flag to verb.create_all_forms para. If there is possibility, that there are two different verbs (like παραβλέπω/παραβλέψω and παραβλέπω/παραδώ), you have to set flag para to True. Fixed issue with non existent imper aor sg of compound verbs with βαίνω (like παρεμβαίνω).
 * 1.0.2 Updated list of irregular past passive participles, deleted most of them as they're not needed anymore and in places they would cause incorrect participle formation.
 * 1.0.1 Project is mature enough, some issue with dependency accentuation module fixed.
 * 0.9.4 Revised library of endings, added support for archaioprepes passive for verbs of type 'θέτω'.
 * 0.9.3 Added support for not very frequently used passive present imperative sg, added support for paratatikos for verbs on ώμαι.
 * 0.9.2 Update focused mainly on paratatikos, now it should deal better with lesser used conjugation types, mainly archaic. Also in passive paratatikos archaic endings 'to' and 'nto' are added to the verbs of basic conjugation types if they are found in corpus (like κυβερνείτο ή κυκλοφορείτο). Fixed issue with some modal verbs.
 * 0.9.1-alpha Substantial update mainly for code readability, but also many bugs fixed in the verb module.
 * 0.8.1  Big update. A lot of changes in verb module in most aspects. Creating perf roots should be more reliable, also added full support for archaic conjugation on ow (πληρώ, ζηλώ, ισούμαι). 
 * 0.7.3-beta Verbs are now forced to create passive paratatikos if there is passive present. 
 * 0.7.3-alpha Fixed bug which prevented participle to decline properly, added athematic participle for bainw.
 * 0.7.2   Fixed bugs that prevented some verbs from creating present passive forms, also verbs of type 'ίσταμαι' now provide all the possible forms together with pass aor participle (stas, stasa, stan).
 * 0.7.1-beta   Redesigned and much improved verb module. More accurate but also more eager to reproduce participles.
 * 0.6.15  Redesigned working with prefixes when creating basic verb forms.
 * 0.6.14  Modification in verb module, with special emphasis on syntheta from exw and agw, that sometimes were unrecognized correctly. Now fixed.
 * 0.6.13  Updated accentuation module, fixed issues with improper reduplication of pparticiples and some bug fixing in verb module.
 * 0.6.12  Updated grammar lists for correct accentuation of proparoxytona nouns on -os, fixed bug affecting one syllable forms of verbs.
 * 0.6.11  Better handling of archaic passive aorist, now creates it for more verbs with existing such a form.
 * 0.6.10  New conjugation type only for verbs of type kathistw, better handling, doesnt generate non existent inflected forms.

 * 0.6.8   Minor review of pronoun module

 * 0.6.1   Extensively revised and fixed adjective and noun modules, now it covers multiple plural forms, also the app now deals better with accentuation of genitives, especially in feminine gender. Now uses extensive lists scraped from Wikileksiko for correct accentuation and for such issues as existence of genitives and the form of vocative ending in declension on -os.
