Welcome to Modern Greek Inflexion's documentation!
==================================================

**MODERN GREEK INFLEXION** is a python library for creating inflected forms of the Modern Greek verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numerals, articles etc. It creates them basing on the Modern Greek grammar rules, list of irregularities and a corpus of Modern Greek language so that the created forms are checked for their existence.
