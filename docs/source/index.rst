Welcome to Modern Greek Inflexion's documentation!
==================================================

**Modern Greek Inflexion** is a Python 3 library that can inflect almost every Modern Greek word (verbs, adjectives, nouns etc.) and it does that correctly in 99% cases. The code is based on Modern Greek Grammar rules, list of irregularities and a language corpus that makes sure the created inflected forms actually exists.
